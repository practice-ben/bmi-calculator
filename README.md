# BMI Calculator
This is a web app created in React. I used plain css to style the app. This was part of an exercise by freeCodeCamp's article on seven react projects for 2023.
## Challenges faced 
The main challenge for this project was making it easy for users to input data pertaining to their weight and height. 
To overcome this challenge, I created input boxes that users can use to type direct values. As they do so, the state is updated and the range values and bmi value is updated.
